# Elements

Imba treats DOM elements first-class citizens, on a much deeper level than JSX. Imba does not use a virtual dom but compiles declarative tag trees into an incredibly efficient [memoized dom](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/the-virtual-dom-is-slow-meet-the-memoized-dom-bb19f546cc52), which is orders of magnitute faster than vdom approaches, yet conceptually simpler.

```imba
# Creating a literal dom element:
let div = <div#main.note.sticky title='Welcome'> 'Hello'
# is essentially equivalent to:
let div = document.createElement('div')
div.id = 'main'
div.classList.add('note')
div.classList.add('sticky')
div.title = 'Welcome'
div.textContent = 'Hello'
```


The first part of your tag literal should be the node name. So, to create a section you write `<section>`, for a list item you write `<li>` and so forth. 

```imba
# ~preview
import 'util/styles'
# ---
let data = {type: 'button', label: 'Hello'}
imba.mount do
    <div.group>
        <section> "A section"
        <{data.type}> data.label
```

It is even possible to spawn a tag with a dynamic type - by using `{}` interpolation in the tag name
```imba
# ~preview
import 'util/styles'
# ---
let data = {type: 'button', label: 'Hello'}
imba.mount do <{data.type} title="Item"> data.label
```

If you don't include a node name, 


## Props & Classes

### ID

To set the id of an element you can use the shorthand `<element#my-id>` syntax
```imba
<div#main> "Hello"
```

### Properties
```imba
<div lang="en" title=data.title> "Hello"
```

### Classes

You can add classes to your elements by adding one or more identifiers preceded by `.` to your tags
```imba
# add note and editorial classes
<div.note.editorial> "Hello"
```
Setting a class only when a certain condition is met can be done using `.class=condition`.
```imba
<div.note.editorial .resolved=data.isResolved> "Hello"
```
When you want to add dynamic classes based on data you can use `{}` for interpolation inside class names:
```imba
let marks = 'rounded important'
let state = 'done'
let color = 'blue'
# ---
<div.item .{marks} .{state} .bg-{color}-200> "Hello"
```
These interpolated classes can also be toggled by a condition:
```imba
<div.item .theme-{user.theme}=app.loggedIn> "Hello"
```

### Inline Styles

```imba
<div[color:red bg:blue padding:8px]> "Hello"
```
Just like classes, styles can be conditionally applied
```imba
<div[color:red bg:blue] [display:none]=app.loggedIn> "Hello"
```

## Nested Elements

Indentation is significant in Imba, and tags follow the same principles. We never explicitly close our tags. Instead, tags are closed implicitly by indentation. So, to add children to an element you simply indent them below:

```imba
<div> <ul>
	<li> <span> 'one'
	<li> <span> 'two'
	<li> <span> 'three'
```
Tags can also be included inside string interpolations, so that templates like this:
```imba
<div>
    "This is "
    <b> "very"
    " important"
```
Can be written like on a single line
```imba
<div> "This is {<b> "very"} important"
```
Also, if you explicitly close your elements using `/>` at the end, you can add multiple elements after one another without problem:
```imba
<label> <input type='checkbox'/> 'Dark Mode'
```

## Conditionals & Loops

There isn't really a difference between templating syntax and other code in Imba. Tag trees are just code, so logic and control flow statements work as you would expect. To render dynamic lists of items you simply write a `for` loop where you want the children to be:
```imba
<div>
    if items
        <h1> "List of items:"
        <ul> for item in items
            <li> <span> item
    else
        <span> "No items found"
```

You can use break, continue and other control flow concepts as well:

```imba
# ~preview=xl
import {movies} from 'imdb'

css .heading c:blue7 fs:xs fw:bold p:2 bc:gray3 bbw:1 pos:sticky t:0 bg:white
css .item mx:2 d:flex px:2 py:3 bc:gray2 bbw:1 bg.hover:gray1
css .title px:1 t:truncate
css .number radius:3 px:2 bg:blue2 mr:1 fs:xs c:blue7 d:grid pc:center

# ---
imba.mount do <div.list> for movie,i in movies
    if i % 10 == 0
        # Add a heading for every 10th item
        <div.heading> "{i + 1} to {i + 10}"
    <div.item>
        <span.number> i + 1
        <span.title> movie.title
    # break out of the loop early
    break if movie.title == 'The Usual Suspects'
```

## Event Handlers

We can use `<tag @event=expression>` to listen to DOM events and run `expression` when theyâ€™re triggered.

```imba
let counter = 0
<button ~[@click=(counter++)]~> "Increment to {counter + 1}"
```

It is important to understand how these event handlers are treated. Imba is created to maximize readability and remove clutter. If you set the value to something that looks like a regular method call, this call (and its arguments) will only be called when the event is actually triggered.

```imba
<div @click=console.log('hey')> 'Will log hey'
```

In the example above, the console.log will only be called when clicking the element. If you just supply a reference to some function, imba will call that handler, with the event as the only argument.

```imba
<div @click=console.log> 'Will log the event'
```

Inside of these lazy handlers you can also refer to the event itself as `e`.

```imba
let x = 0
<button @click=console.log(e.type,e.x,e.y)> "Click"
<button @mousemove=(x = e.x)> "Mouse at {x}"
```
To learn more about event handling jump to the [Events section](/docs/events/basics).


## Fragments

Fragments can be created using empty tag literals `<>`.

# Declarative Rendering

The fact that tag literals generate real dom nodes means that we can add/remove/modify the dom in an imperative way. In theory.

```imba
# ~preview=xl
import 'util/styles'

# ---
let array = ["First","Second"]

let view = <main>
    <button @click=array.push('More')> 'Add'
    <ul.list> for item in array
        <li> item

# view is a real native DOM element
document.body.appendChild view
```
Even tough we rendered a dynamic list of items, it won't update if new items are added to the array or if members of the array change. Clicking the button will actually add items, but our view is clearly not keeping up. What to do?

## Mounting

To make the tag tree update when our data changes, we need to add pass the tree to `imba.mount`.

```imba
# ~preview=xl
import 'util/styles'

# ---
let array = ["First","Second"]

imba.mount do 
    <main>
        <button @click=array.push('More')> 'Add'
        <ul.list> for item in array
            <li> item
```
Now you will see that when you click the button, our view instantly updates to reflect the new state. How does this happen without a virtual dom? The array is not being tracked in a special way (it is just a plain array), and we are only dealing with real dom elements, which are only changed and updated when there is real need for it. Imba uses a technique we call `memoized dom`, and you can read more about how it works [here](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/the-virtual-dom-is-slow-meet-the-memoized-dom-bb19f546cc52). Here is a more advanced example with more dynamic data and even dynamic inline styles:

```imba
# ~preview=xl
import 'util/styles'

css div pos:absolute d:block inset:0 p:4
css mark pos:absolute
css li d:inline-block px:1 m:1 radius:2 fs:xs bg:gray1 @hover:blue2

# ---
let x = 20, y = 20, title = "Hey"

imba.mount do
    <main @mousemove=(x=e.x,y=e.y)>
        <input bind=title>
        <label> "Mouse is at {x} {y}"
        <mark[x:{x} y:{y} rotate:{x / 360}]> "Item"
        <ul> for nr in [0 ... y]
            <li> nr % 12 and nr or title
```

By default Imba will **render your whole application whenever anything *may* have changed**. Imba isn't tracking anything. This sounds insane right? Isn't there a reason for all the incredibly complex state management libraries and patterns that track updates and wraps your data in proxies and all that? As long as you have mounted your root element using `imba.mount` you usually don't need to think more about it.

## Updating

 The default approach of Imba is to re-render the mounted application after every handled DOM event. If a handler is asynchronous (using await or returning a promise), Imba will also re-render after the promise is finished. Practically all state changes in applications happen as a result of some user interaction.

In the few occasions where you need to manually make sure views are updated, you should call `imba.commit`. It schedules an update for the next animation frame, and things will only be rerendered once even if you call `imba.commit` a thousand times. It returns a promise that resolves after the actual updates are completed, which is practical when you need to ensure that the view is in sync before doing something.

##### commit from websocket
```imba
socket.addEventListener('message',imba.commit)
```
> Calling `imba.commit` after every message from socket will ensure that your views are up-to-date when your state changes as a result of some socket message.

##### commit after fetching data
```imba
def load
    let res = await window.fetch("/items")
    state.items = await res.json!
    imba.commit!
```

# Components

## Declarations

### Web Components

Components are reusable elements with functionality and children attached to them. Components are *just like regular classes* and uses all the same syntax to declare properties, methods, getters and setters. To create a Component, use the keyword `tag` followed by a component name according to web-component's custom component naming convention. It must contain at least two words separated by a dash. 

```imba
tag app-component
    # add methods, properties, ...
```

These components are compiled to [native Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) and are *global* in your project. As long as you have imported the component *somewhere in your code*, you can create instances of the component anywhere.

### Local Components

Custom Elements that start with an uppercase letter is treated as a local component.

Sometimes you want to define custom components that are local to a subsystem of your application. Other parts don't need to know about it, and you definitely don't want it to cause collisions with other parts.
```imba
tag Header
    <self> "App header"

tag App
    <self>
        <Header>
        <main> "Application"
```

As opposed to web components, local components must be exported and imported in the files where they are actually used.

### Functional Components

Any method can essentially act like a component in Imba.

```imba
def app-list items
    <ul> for item in items
        <li> item

const array = [1,2,3]
imba.mount do <div> app-list(array)
```

## Properties

## Attributes


## Slots

Sometimes you want to allow taking in elements from the outside and render them somewhere inside the tree of your component. `<slot>` is a placeholder for the content being passed in from the outside.

##### Basic slot
```imba
tag app-option
    <self>
        <input type="checkbox">
        <label> ~[<slot>]~

<app-option>
    ~[<b> "Option name"
    <span> "Description for this option"]~
```

Anything inside the `<slot>` will be shown if no content is supplied from outside.

```imba
tag app-option
    <self>
        <input type="checkbox">
        <label> ~[<slot> "Unnamed option"]~
<app-option>
```
You can also add named slots using `<slot name=...>` and render into them using `<el for=slotname>` in the outer rendering.
```imba
# ~preview
import 'util/styles'
css body d:flex

css app-panel
	header p:1 bg:gray3
	main p:3 fs:md
	footer p:1 bg:gray1

# ---
tag app-panel
    <self.panel>
        <header> ~[<slot name="header"> "Default Header"]~
        <main> ~[<slot> <p> "Default Body"]~
        <footer> ~[<slot name="footer"> "Default Footer"]~

imba.mount do <app-panel>
    ~[<div slot="header"> "Custom Header"
    <div> "Something in main slot"
    <div> "More in main slot"]~
```

## Named Elements

It can be useful to keep references to certain child elements inside a component. This can be done using `<node$reference>` syntax.

```imba
# ~preview
import 'util/styles'

# ---
tag app-panel
    <self.group>
        <button @click=($name.value += 'Hi')> "Write"
        <input$name type='text'>
# ---

imba.mount <app-panel>
```
In the code above, `$name` is available everywhere inside `app-panel` component, but also from outside the app-panel as a property of the component.

## Context API


# Data Binding

## Basic Usage

##### text
```imba
# ~preview
import 'util/styles'

imba.mount do <section>
	<input type='text' bind=message>
	<label> "Message is {message}"
```

##### textarea
```imba
# ~preview
import 'util/styles'

# ---
let tweet = ''

imba.mount do <section>
	<textarea bind=tweet placeholder="What's on your mind...">
	<label> "Written {tweet.length} characters"
```

##### range
```imba
# ~preview
import 'util/styles'

# ---
let point = {r:0, x:0}

imba.mount do <section[gap:2]>
    <input type='range' bind=point.x>
    <input type='range' bind=point.r>
    <label[js:center w:40px rotate:{point.r}deg x:{point.x}]> "{point.x},{point.r}"
```

##### number
```imba
# ~preview
import 'util/styles'

# ---
let a=1, b=2

imba.mount do <div.group>
    <input type='number' min=0 max=100 bind=a/> " + "
    <input type='number' min=0 max=100 bind=b/> " = "
    <samp> "{a + b}"
```

##### checkbox
```imba
# ~preview
import 'util/styles'
# ---
let bool=no

imba.mount do <section>
    <label>
        <input[mr:1] type='checkbox' bind=bool />
        <span> "Enabled: {bool}"
```
##### checkbox with array
```imba
# ~preview
import {genres} from 'imdb'
import 'util/styles'

css div d:flex flf:row wrap pi:center jc:flex-start

# ---
let options = ['React','Vue','Imba','Svelte','Ember']
let interests = []

imba.mount do <section>
    <div> for option in options
        <label[mr:2]>
            <input type='checkbox' bind=interests value=option/>
            <span[pl:1]> option
    <label> "Interested in {interests.join(', ')}"
```

##### radio
```imba
# ~preview
import {genres} from 'imdb'
import 'util/styles'

css div d:flex flf:row wrap pi:center jc:flex-start

# ---
let options = ['React','Vue','Imba','Svelte','Ember']
let interest = 'Imba'

imba.mount do <section>
    <div> for option in options
        <label[mr:2]>
            <input type='radio' bind=interest value=option/>
            <span[pl:1]> option
    <label> "Interested in {interest}"
```

##### select
```imba
# ~preview
import {genres} from 'imdb'
import 'util/styles'

css div d:flex flf:row wrap pi:center jc:flex-start

# ---
let options = ['React','Vue','Imba','Svelte','Ember']
let focus = 'Imba'

imba.mount do <section>
    <select bind=focus> for item in options
        <option value=item> item
    <label> "Focused on {focus}"
```

##### multiselect
```imba
# ~preview
import {genres} from 'imdb'
import 'util/styles'

css div d:flex flf:row wrap pi:center jc:flex-start

# ---
import {projects} from 'util/data'

let choices = []

imba.mount do <section>
    <select multiple bind=choices> for item in projects
        <option value=item> item.name
    <label> "Interested in"
    <div> for item in choices
        <div[color:{item.color}]> item.name
```

##### button
```imba
# ~preview
import {genres} from 'imdb'
import 'util/styles'

# ---
let state = 'one'
css button.checked shadow:inset bg:gray2 o:0.6

imba.mount do <section>
    <div.group>
        <button bind=state value='one'> "one"
        <button bind=state value='two'> "two"
    <label> "State is {state}"
```
> Buttons bound to data behave just like checkboxes. A `checked` class indicates when their value matches the bound data. Clicking a button multiple times will toggle just like a checkbox.

## Custom Bindings

##### custom elements
```imba
# ~preview
import 'util/styles'

# ---
let options = {
    width: 12
    height: 12
    title: 'Something'
}

tag Field
    get type
        typeof data == 'number' ? 'range' : 'text'

    <self[d:flex js:stretch]>
        <label[w:80px]> <slot> 'Field'
        <input[flex:1] type=type bind=data>

imba.mount do <section>
    <Field bind=options.title> 'Title'
    <Field bind=options.width> 'Width'
    <Field bind=options.height> 'Height'
    <label> "{options.title} is {options.width}x{options.height}"
```

##### combination
```imba
# ~preview
import {genres} from 'imdb'
import 'util/styles'

css div d:flex flf:row wrap pi:center jc:flex-start

# ---
let people = [{name: 'Jane Doe', interests: ['Imba']}]
let person = people[0]

def addPerson
    person = {name: 'John',interests:[]}
    people.push(person)

def addInterest e
    person.interests.push e.target.value
    e.target.value = ''

imba.mount do <main>
    <header>
        <select bind=person>  for item in people
            <option value=item> item.name
        <button[ml:2] @click=addPerson> 'Add'
    <article>
        <label[ta:left]> "Editing {person.name}:"
        <input bind=person.name placeholder="Name...">
        <input placeholder="Add interest..." @keyup.enter.prevent=addInterest>
        <div.tags> for item in person.interests
            <button[mr:1].chip bind=person.interests value=item> item
```



# Lifecycle


## Hooks

These methods are meant to be defined in your components. In most cases you will only define a `render` method, and possibly `awaken` if you want to do some additional initialization when the element is first attached to the document.

| table  |  | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `build` | Called before any properties etc are set | |
| `hydrate` | Called before awaken if element is not hydrated | |
| `dehydrate` | Called before serializing when rendering on server | |
| `awaken` | Called the first time the component is mounted | |
| `mount` | Called when the component is attached to the document | |
| `unmount` | Called when the component is detached from the document | |
| `render` | Called by both visit and tick | |
| `rendered` | Called after every `render` | |
| `tick` | Called on every imba.commit when component is scheduled |
| `visit` | Called when parent element is rendered |
| `commit` | Called by both visit and tick |

## States

Components also has a bunch of methods that you can call to inspect where in the lifecycle a component is:

| table  |  |
| --- | --- |
| `hydrated?` | Is this element created on the client (by imba) or has it been rehydrated? |
| `awakened?` | Called the first time the tag is mounted |
| `mounting?` | Is component in the process of being mounted? |
| `mounted?` | Is component attached to the document? |
| `render?` | Should component render? |
| `rendered?` | Has component been rendered? |
| `scheduled?` | Is component scheduled? |

## Hydration

Explain concepts of hydration

## Scheduling

##### Setup timer
```imba
tag app-clock
    def mount
        # call render every second
        $timer = setInterval(render.bind(self),1000)
    
    def unmount
        # remember to clear interval when tag unmounts
        clearInterval($timer)

    # if you _only_ want the clock to render via timer
    # and not when the parent element renders - we also
    # need to override visit
    def visit
        return
```
- Setting up a timer in mount and clearing it in unmount

##### Override visit
```imba
tag app-clock
    def visit
        commit! unless scheduled?
```
